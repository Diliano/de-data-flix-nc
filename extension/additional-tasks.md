# Additional Tasks

We've had an issue recently with certain customers not looking after the films they're renting from us! Unfortunately there is no data on this and it is making our stock numbers inaccurate. 

1. Create a query that updates the `stock` table to include some way of tracking the condition of our rental copies.

2. Create a query that updates all current stock apart from _Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker_ to be **undamaged** (Jersey was not a fan of that one).
